## Features
- Custom Go SSG: The site is not built with off-the-shelf frameworks like Hugo or Jekyll. The entire build logic—from parsing Markdown files to rendering HTML—is handled by a custom Go application.

- Markdown-Based Content: All posts and pages are written in Markdown with YAML front matter for metadata.

- Build-Time Syntax Highlighting: Code blocks are highlighted at build time using the pure-Go Chroma library, ensuring fast page loads with no client-side JavaScript dependency for styling.

- Frontend Tooling: The project uses pnpm to manage a modern frontend pipeline featuring Sass for advanced styling and esbuild for fast TypeScript bundling and minification.

- Automated CI/CD Pipeline: The build and deployment process is fully automated with GitHub Actions. Pushing a specially formatted Git tag (post/...) triggers the workflow, which builds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

## Tech Stack
- Static Site Generator: Go
- Content: Markdown with YAML Front Matter parsed with Goldmark
- Styling: SCSS compiled with Dart Sass
- JavaScript: TypeScript (bundled with esbuild)
- Package Manager: pnpm
- Deployment: GitHub Actions

## How to Run
### 1. Install Dependencies
```shell
go install github.com/cortesi/devd/cmd/devd@latest

brew install chroma

chroma --html-styles --style=github > layout/styles/chroma.css

pnpm install
```

### 2. Build Project
```shell
pnpm run build
```

### 3. Run the Development Server
```shell
pnpm run serve
```

### 4. Rebuild Project
```shell
pnpm run watch
```
This command checks for changes to layout directory files and executes `pnpm run build`.

## How to Use devd
```shell
devd DIR_NAME # Run the server from the DIR_NAME directory

devd -l DIR_NAME # Run the server using livereload

devd -o DIR_NAME # Run the server and Open the browser

devd -ol DIR_NAME # Run the server and open a browser using livereload.
```

## How to Deploy
To publish a new post or deploy changes, you must push a specially formatted Git tag. The deployment is handled automatically by GitHub Actions.

### 1. Commit Your Changes
First, make sure all your new content and changes are committed to the main branch.

```shell
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "post: foo: boo"

# Push the commit to the main branch
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create a Deploy Tag
The deployment workflow is triggered by a tag. Create a new tag based on the current date. The format is post/YYYY-MM-DD-XX, where XX is a two-digit number for posts on the same day (e.g., 01, 02).

```shell
# Example for the first post on September 23, 2025
git tag post/2025-09-23-01
```

### 3. Push the Tag to Deploy
Push the newly created tag to GitHub. This is the final step that will trigger the automatic build and deployment process.

```shell
git push origin post/2025-09-23-01
```

You can now go to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to watch the deployment progress. Your site will be live with the new content in a few minutes.
