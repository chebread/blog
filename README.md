## Tech Stack
- Static Site Generator (SSG): Go

## How to Run
### Install Dependencies
```shell
go install github.com/cortesi/devd/cmd/devd@latest

brew install chroma

chroma --html-styles --style=github > layout/styles/chroma.css

pnpm install
```

### Build Project
```shell
pnpm run build
```

### Run the Development Server
```shell
pnpm run serve
```

### Rebuild Project
```shell
pnpm run watch
```
This command checks for changes to layout directory files and executes `pnpm run build`.

## How to Use devd
```shell
devd DIR_NAME # Run the server from the DIR_NAME directory

devd -l DIR_NAME # Run the server using livereload

devd -o DIR_NAME # Run the server and Open the browser

devd -ol DIR_NAME # Run the server and open a browser using livereload

killall devd # Kill devd process
```

## How to Create Manual Anchor Links
You can create links that jump to specific headings within a page. This is useful for building a table of contents.

### Assign a Custom ID to a Heading
Append {#your-custom-id} directly after your heading text. This ID will be the target for your link.

```md
## My Awesome Section {#section-1}
```

### Link to the Heading
Use the standard Markdown link syntax. The URL part should be a # followed by the custom ID you created.

```md
[Go to my awesome section](#section-1)
```

### Example

```md
## Table of Contents
- [Go to Section 1](#section-1)
- [Go to Section 2](#section-2)

## My Awesome Section {#section-1}
Here is the content for the first section.

## Another Awesome Section {#section-2}
Here is the content for the second section.
```

### Note
It is recommended to use only letters, numbers, and hyphens (-) for IDs to ensure URL compatibility. Special characters (like ?, &) should be avoided. Korean characters are also supported.

## How to Deploy
To publish a new post or deploy changes, you must push a specially formatted Git tag. The deployment is handled automatically by GitHub Actions.

### Commit Your Changes
First, make sure all your new content and changes are committed to the main branch.

```shell
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "post: foo: boo"

# Push the commit to the main branch
git push origin main
```

### Create a Deploy Tag
The deployment workflow is triggered by a tag. Create a new tag based on the current date. The format is post/YYYY-MM-DD-XX, where XX is a two-digit number for posts on the same day (e.g., 01, 02).

```shell
# Example for the first post on September 23, 2025
git tag post/2025-09-23-01
```

### Push the Tag to Deploy
Push the newly created tag to GitHub. This is the final step that will trigger the automatic build and deployment process.

```shell
git push origin post/2025-09-23-01
```

You can now go to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to watch the deployment progress. Your site will be live with the new content in a few minutes.
